This Xcode project is a slightly modified version of a code challenge I performed in 2020 as part of a job application for
an iOS developer position. I did not get the job finally, but my solution to the code challenge brought me to a second job interview.

The iOS App is implemented using Swift, SwiftUI and Combine. It consist of mainly one screen that constitute a shopping basket that 
can open two related sheet views.

In software terms and generally speaking, the solution demonstrates my abilities to:

- write clean and readable code
- use standard software architectures and patterns such as MVVM, delegation and dependency injection
- construct presentable UI (although simple)

Furthermore, it demonstrates my knowledge about and ability to work with specific technologies, such as:

- Swift, SwiftUI, Combine, HTTP request, JSON data, Git

Note that there is flaw in the App that I am still working on to solve. For unknown reasons, the hit area of the small +/- buttons on the main 
screen is a bit misplaced. Intended functionality can be obtained by hitting the buttons a bit down and left to the center of a button.
